### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Antoreep Jana from India, and I do AI stuff across many domains like Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning. I enjoy working in Computer Vision among the various domains. However, I do hold good conceptual as well as practical understanding of other domains in AI. You can check out my work on github as well as kaggle.

I also share educational content on my YT Channel. Find it @ youtube.com/user/antoreepjana
